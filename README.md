# Geowebapp
Purpose: I am making this project to learn folium library and also to learn to make Map in Webapp.

In this project we made the following:
1) Used Folium for Webapp Map
2) Used Pandas for reading and using Location Data
3) We made markers along with a google link provided on Marker to get information about Volcano
4) Then we Used a population data to mark different contries with different colors on basis of its population
5) We also implement a Layer Control mechanism in this Webapp. SO that if we want to see only one Layer we can only turn it on and keep rest layers off except the base map layer ;)
6) We also used 'FeatureGroup' feature of Folium.

How to run this project?
To run this project you only need a browser to see the Webapp and python3 environment. You only need to Install all the packages from requirements.txt using command "pip install -r requirements.txt" and run the Geo_Webapp.py file using "python3 Geo_Webapp.py" file.

Hope you like this project :)
